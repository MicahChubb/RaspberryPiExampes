# RaspberryPiExampes
This is going to be a dumping ground of examples for my students to have a look at. Rather than making a lot of repositories for short examples, I am going to start compiling more general purpose ones with subsections

## Examples
- **ArduinoRaspberryPi**: How to communicate with an Arduino from a Raspberry Pi
- **BlobDetectExamples**: How to detect / manipulate blobs for machine vision
- **ExploreOpencvDnn**: Machine vision clasification example
- **OCR example**: Extracting text from images
- **PythonMotor**: How to control motors with python
- **AsymmetricEncription**: How to use public and private keys to transmit data "securely"
