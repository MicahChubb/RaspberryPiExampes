# You may run into issues installing pytesseract, this is because python wants you to install things into virtual environments
# For our usecase, venv aren't super useful as we are only making one project at a time, so use the flags below:
# sudo pip3 install pytesseract --break-system-packages
from PIL import Image
import pytesseract
import cv2
import os, sys, inspect #For dynamic filepaths
import numpy as np;

#Find the execution path and join it with the direct reference
def execution_path(filename):
  return os.path.join(os.path.dirname(inspect.getfile(sys._getframe(1))), filename)			

filename = execution_path("1_python-ocr.jpg")
img = np.array(Image.open(filename))
text = pytesseract.image_to_string(img)

print(text)
